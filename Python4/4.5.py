#Description: Write a script that uses range() in a for loop to print out every number between 0 and 99

#Range will consider the number in the 0th position, so if you want 1-98 (between 0 and 99) your range is 1,99. If want 0-99, your range is 0,100.

for i in range(1,99):
	print(i)

print("\nDone.")
